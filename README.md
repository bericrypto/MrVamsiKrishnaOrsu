# To, Mr. Vamsi Krishna Orsu
I put a link as I don't have linkedin premium to type more than 200 characters in linkedin. If you don't wanna read this yapping you can skip the next para too ðŸ˜‚ but the question after is important ðŸ‘€

I'm a computer science engineering student currently in the final year. I know basics in hacking and some tools which I got to know from HackTheBox labs. I have Certified in Cybersecurity by ISC2 (It was too easy and theoritical, I kinda regret paying 4.5k for it). I want to do OSCP certification but that costs 1.5 lakh which I can't offered now. To get a good cybersecurity job right out of the college, I need to have a good certification. I'm also aspiring to join Red Team. Since you are living my goal, I wanted to take your suggestions. Please feel free to give any other advices like where to start being a pentester.

### What is the best pentester certification (or any cybersecurity certification) which is renowned and under around 40k rupees or less?

Thank you, (to Vamsi)
